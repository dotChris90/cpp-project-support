A Personal extension for C++ projects.

Handle C++ projects are always difficult (since C++ is powerful and with too many options) ...

In order to setup C++ projects fast and in order to easily get : 

- packages dependency graph
- targets dependency graph
- preview of doxygen documentation
- cppchecks 
- style guide checks
- guide lines checks
- project templates 
- much more ... 

I transformed my "cheat sheet and knowledge" into an VS Code extension.

This extension shall combine : 

- conan for packages
- cmake for build 
- cppcheck for static code checks before build
- doxygen for documentation (including execution flow)
- metrix with Metrix++

P.S. Until I have a proper logo - i use the Iso C++ Logo
